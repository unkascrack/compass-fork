/**
 * The main interface between a Java application and Compass.
 *
 * <p>Provides the basic operations with semantic mapped objects (save, delete, and
 * load/get). The session provides operations on both the objects levels and
 * Resource levels (indexed object model). The CompassSession operations are
 * delegated to the underlying SearchEngine, so no direct access to the
 * SearchEngine is needed.
 *
 * <p>Implementations will not be thread safe, Instead each thread/transaction
 * should obtain its own instance from a Compass.
 *
 * <p>If the CompassSession throws an exception, the transaction must be rolled
 * back and the session discarded. The internal state of the CompassSession
 * might not be consistent with the search engine if discarded.
 *
 * <p>Using the session depends on how transaction managemnet should be done (also see
 * {@link Compass#openSession()}. The simplest form looks like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * CompassSession session = compass.openSession();
 * try {
 *      // do operations with the session
 *      session.commit(); // same as session.close()
 * } catch (Exception e) {
 *      session.rollback();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A more complex form includes explicit control using {@link CompassTransaction}:
 *
 * <pre>
 * CompassSession session = compass.openSession();
 * CompassTransaction tx = null;
 * try {
 * 	  tx = session.beginTransaction();
 * 	  Object result = compassCallback.doInCompass(session);
 * 	  tx.commit();
 * 	  return result;
 * } catch (RuntimeException e) {
 * 	  if (tx != null) {
 * 		  tx.rollback();
 * 	  }
 * 	  throw e;
 * } finally {
 * 	  session.close();
 * }
 * </pre>
